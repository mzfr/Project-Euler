 // Fined the smallest number which is divisible by each number from 1 to 20

/*
This problem is really easy to solve though it looks complicated at first but it really simple
First to find the smallest number that is divisble by each number from 1 t 20 we need to  find the number that is divisble by each number 1 to 20 and then we can find the smallest number which follow the rule of divisibilty from each number 1 to 20

To find the number that is divisible by each of the numer from 1 to 20 we can simply just multiple all the number from 1 to 20.We'll get a number that will be divisible form each of the number from 1 to 20 bt that won't be the smsallest number.
Now to find the smallest number we can do the prime factorization of all the number from 1 to 20 and then can cancel the powers.

Example :
Like we have to find smallest number that is divisible by each number 2 to 5.
So, we can do prime factorisation of all the number from 2 to 5
i.e. for 2 = 2
         3 = 3
         4 = 2*2
         5 = 5
 so as we ca see that t2 is appearing two times in prime factorisation of 4 so we can just take two 2's that will make the product of all the number from 2 to 5 ,  from 120 to 60 and still the new product i.e. 60 is divisible by each number from 2 to 5.

 same can be done with all the number from 1 to 20 or greater.
