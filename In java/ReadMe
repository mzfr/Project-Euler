# Project Euler solution

-  My solution for the project euler in java.

- You can also try to solve them by yourself using any language.
- Some of solution are just the text without the code because those were simple problems that i felt doesn't needed any              computational calculation.
- In project Euler there is no rule like You have to use any programming to solve the problems, you can solve them using paper and pen.
